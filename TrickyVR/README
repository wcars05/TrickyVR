Welcome to TrickyVR

This is a simple application that demostrates a way to load an view optical illusion images via a headset in a SIMPLE application.
This project works with Visual Studio 2015

The intent is to have something useful for your Occulus Rift DK1.

What this does do:
	Shows the minimal effort to have an image that is aligned for each eye to view.
	Provides a basic example of a Visual C# application with a WinForm and simple UI.

What this doesn't do:
	Does not correct for the lense skew in the headset.
	Does not manage your monitors/displays
	


Todo:
	Image drag and drop
	Url loaded images?
